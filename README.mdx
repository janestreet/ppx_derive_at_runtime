ppx_derive_at_runtime - create your own deriver without writing ppx code
========================================================================

Define a new deriver without writing ppx code, just by naming a
runtime module.

This allows specifying new ppx derivers much more easily than writing
a ppx by hand. For example, to get `[@@deriving foo]`, you only have to
specify a module path such as `My_library.Foo`.

The primary tradeoff is runtime cost. The generated code derives each
value by calling functions in the runtime module, passing in a GADT
describing the type (tuple, record, variant, etc.). This can incur
startup cost and can produce less performant code than a hand-written
ppx.

_Dune users:_ Some of the advice below applies to `jbuild`s, which are
still used internally at Jane Street. Translate as appropriate for
`dune` files.

# What ppx derivers do

Use of `[@@deriving]` clauses is ubiquitous in OCaml, especially in
code based on the `Base` and `Core` libraries. We annotate types with
clauses such as `[@@deriving compare, equal, hash, quickcheck, sexp]`
to automatically generate code for comparisons, hash functions, random
generators, and human-readable serializations. This saves a lot of
boilerplate, and provides easy to use and uniform behavior for several
widely used idioms.

## Writing ppx derivers by hand

Sometimes, a project introduces a new idiom that applies to many
types. Writing a ppx deriver would save a lot of boilerplate at every
type definition. For example, one might want a `size` operation on
various datatypes, perhaps to measure space usage over time or to
collect metrics on relative sizes of different data sets.

To write a ppx deriving a `size` operation, one must first write a
transformation that reads the AST of a type declaration and produces
the AST of a corresponding definition for a `size` function. The OCaml
AST is a large set of type definitions with arcane names, based on
outdated idioms, and with little documentation. Manipulating code
snippets in the AST is so cumbersome it is usually done indirectly
with a custom ppx called "metaquot" (sic). This AST transformation for
definitions in structures, along with a corresponding one for
declarations in signatures, must then be registered with `ppxlib`.

All of this is to say that writing a ppx deriver by hand has a high
barrier to entry, a potentially steep learning curve, and requires a
fair amount of boilerplate itself.

# What `ppx_derive_at_runtime` does

Using `ppx_derive_at_runtime`, one can write a new ppx deriver much
more straightforwardly. The main work is writing a runtime library
that conforms to `Ppx_derive_at_runtime_lib.S`, then registering only
the name of that module with `ppx_derive_at_runtime`. All AST handling
and ppx boilerplate is pre-written.

## Writing ppx derivers with `ppx_derive_at_runtime`

To write a ppx deriving a `size` operation, there are two steps.

1. Write a module implementing `'a Size.t` for `size` operations on
values of type `'a` and satisfying `Ppx_derive_at_runtime_lib.S`.

2. Register the name of that module with `ppx_derive_at_runtime`.

There is no need to deal with `ppxlib` or the AST types at all.

## Run-time implementation

Here is the interface for the `Size` module in `example/size.mli`:

<!-- $MDX file=example/size.mli -->
```ocaml
(** Defines how to derive a [size] function using [ppx_derive_at_runtime]. *)
open! Base

(** The type of [size] operations. *)
type 'a t = 'a -> int

(** Transforms an ['a t] to a ['b t]. Because [t] is contravariant -- that is, ['a] is an
    input rather than an output -- we must "unmap" inputs of type ['b] to type ['a] to
    pass to the original ['a t]. *)
val unmap : 'a t -> f:('b -> 'a) -> 'b t

(** Size operations for builtin types. When deriving [size], [open] this module. *)
module Export : sig
  val size_string : string t
  val size_list : 'a t -> 'a list t
end

(** Used as an attribute when deriving size. Types annotated with [[@size Ignore]] are not
    included in the total. *)
module Ignore : sig
  type t = Ignore
end

(** Derives [t]. Per the definition of [S_with_basic_attribute], the [[@size]] attribute
    may be used the same way on types, record labels, variant constructors, and
    polymorphic variant rows. *)
include
  Ppx_derive_at_runtime_lib.S_with_basic_attribute
  with type 'a t := 'a t
   and type _ attribute := Ignore.t
```

Here is the implementation for the `Size` module in `example/size.ml`:

<!-- $MDX file=example/size.ml -->
```ocaml
open! Base

(** The type of [size] operations. *)
type 'a t = 'a -> int

(** Transforming a size operation is straightforward function composition. *)
let unmap t ~f x = t (f x)

(** Strings and lists have natural size operations. *)
module Export = struct
  let size_string = String.length
  let size_list size_elt list = List.sum (module Int) list ~f:size_elt
end

(** Defining the [Ignore] attribute type. *)
module Ignore = struct
  type t = Ignore
end

(** We provide straightforward combinators on [t] to define how to derive values. *)
include Ppx_derive_at_runtime_lib.Of_basic (struct
    type nonrec 'a t = 'a t
    type _ attribute = Ignore.t

    (** In general, we can derive for covariant, contravariant, or invariant types, so we
        may need to "map", "unmap", or both. In this case, we only need to "unmap". *)
    let map_unmap t ~to_:_ ~of_ = unmap t ~f:of_

    (** Unit has a trivial size. Using 1 instead of 0 -- or, for that matter, 2 or any
        other number -- is an arbitrary choice. *)
    let unit () = 1

    (** Nothing doesn't have a size. If that makes sense. *)
    let nothing = Nothing.unreachable_code

    (** Pairs add the sizes of both constituents. We arbitrarily choose not to add a
        constant for the pair constructor itself. *)
    let both at bt : (_ * _) t = fun (a, b) -> at a + bt b

    (** Variants just take the size of either part. Again, we arbitrarily choose not to
        increment for the variant constructor itself. *)
    let either at bt : (_, _) Either.t t = function
      | First a -> at a
      | Second b -> bt b
    ;;

    (** The [Ignore] attribute means we produce a constant size of zero. *)
    let with_attribute (type a) (_ : a t) (Ignore : Ignore.t) : a t = Fn.const 0

    (** For (mutually) recursive types, we force the lazy definition on demand. *)
    let recursive (type a) (at : a t Lazy.t) : a t = fun a -> (Lazy.force at) a
  end)
```

Our implementation of `Size` is particularly simple because we are
able to define it using `Ppx_derive_at_runtime_lib.Of_basic`. This
functor supports _extensional_ derived values, meaning ones that are
based only on the runtime contents of a type. There is another example
of an extensional derivation in `example/comparison.mli` and
`example/comparison.ml`, which derives `compare` and `equal` values
similar to `[@@deriving compare, equal]`.

More complex examples include _intensional_ derived values, which may
depend on details such as the names of record labels or variant
constructors. To implement these, see the documentation and helpers
provided in `lib/ppx_derive_at_runtime_lib_intf.ml` and the example in
`example/serialization.mli` and `example/serialization.ml`, which
derives `sexp_of` and `of_sexp` values similar to `[@@deriving sexp]`.

## Compile-time registration

After defining a runtime library, the only step left is to register it
with `ppx_derive_at_runtime_lib`. For `Size`, we do this in
`for-doc/ppx_derive_at_runtime_for_doc.ml`.

<!-- $MDX file=for-doc/ppx_derive_at_runtime_for_doc.ml -->
```ocaml
open! Base

let () =
  Ppx_derive_at_runtime.register_fully_qualified_runtime_module
    [%here]
    "Ppx_derive_at_runtime_example.Size"
  |> Ppxlib.Deriving.ignore
;;
```

Registering a deriver this way should be done in a separate library.
This library should be declared as a ppx rewriter and should list
`Size`'s library as a ppx runtime dependency. For example, see
`for-doc/jbuild`:

<!-- $MDX file=for-doc/jbuild -->
```
(library (
  (name        ppx_derive_at_runtime_for_doc)
  (public_name ppx_derive_at_runtime.for_doc)
  (kind        ppx_rewriter)
  (libraries             (ppx_derive_at_runtime))
  (ppx_runtime_libraries (ppx_derive_at_runtime_example))
  (js_of_ocaml ())
  (only_erasable_extensions true)))
```

Code using `[@@deriving size]` should include
`ppx_derive_at_runtime_for_doc` in the `preprocess` clause of its
`jbuild` file.

## Alternative compile-time registration

Another way to register derivers is as a one-off inside a
`preprocess` clause, if a deriver is only meant to be used in one or
two places. In this case, instead of defining a ppx library, use
`ppx_derive_at_runtime_locally` in your `preprocess` clause and pass
it a `-derive-from-module` flag with the module name as an argument.
In `jbuild` files, arguments must be preceded with a `-`, which
`ppx_derive_at_runtime_locally` strips off. The
`ppx_derive_at_runtime_locally` module must be included repeatedly to
add more arguments. For example, see `test/jbuild`.

<!-- $MDX file=test/jbuild -->
```
(library (
  (name        ppx_derive_at_runtime_test)
  (public_name ppx_derive_at_runtime.test)
  (libraries (base expect_test_helpers_base ppx_derive_at_runtime_example))
  (preprocess (
    pps (
      ppx_jane
      ppx_derive_at_runtime_locally
      -derive-from-module
      -Ppx_derive_at_runtime_example.Comparison
      ppx_derive_at_runtime_locally
      -derive-from-module
      -Ppx_derive_at_runtime_example.Sample
      ppx_derive_at_runtime_locally
      -derive-from-module
      -Ppx_derive_at_runtime_example.Serialization)))
  (only_erasable_extensions true)))
```

# Using derivers written with `ppx_derive_at_runtime`

To use a deriver based on a module path, just use the last part of the
module path, uncapitalized, as the name for `[@@deriving]`. For
example, here we derive values based on
`Ppx_derive_at_runtime_example.Size`:

```ocaml
open Ppx_derive_at_runtime_example
open Size.Export

module Name = struct
  type t = { first_name : string; last_name : string } [@@deriving size]
end
```

This defines a value named `size` of type `t Size.t`, which happens to
be defined as `Sexp.t`. We open `Size.Export` so that `size_string` is in
scope to derive values for the `first_name` and `last_name` labels.

```ocaml
# Name.size { first_name = "Ada"; last_name = "Lovelace" }
- : int = 11
```

## Type names other than `t`

```ocaml
type partnership = Name.t * Name.t [@@deriving size]
```

If you define a type other than `t`, the derived value has a suffix
based on the type name. In this case, the value is `size_partnership`.

```ocaml
# size_partnership
    ( { first_name = "Alonzo"; last_name = "Church" }
    , { first_name = "Alan"; last_name = "Turing" }
    )
- : int = 22
```

## Overriding derived values

You can annotate any type expression with `[@size.custom]`,
renamed appropriately for your deriver, to override the normally
derived value. For example, if there is no `size_bytes` in
scope, you could write:

```ocaml
module Name_buffer = struct
  type t =
    { first_name : (bytes [@size.custom Bytes.length])
    ; last_name : (bytes [@size.custom Bytes.length])
    }
  [@@deriving size]
end
```

The resulting definition uses the provided value instead of deriving one
for the annotated type expression.

```ocaml
# Name_buffer.size { first_name = Bytes.create 7; last_name = Bytes.create 5 }
- : int = 12
```

## Annotating types

You can also use the `[@size]` attribute, once again renamed
appropriately for your deriver, to annotate type expressions, record
labels, variant constructors, and polymorphic variant rows. The
payload of the attribute is an expression. Runtime modules specify an
attribute type for each of those four contexts.

```ocaml
module History = struct
  type t =
    { current_title : string
    ; previous_titles : (string list [@size Ignore])
    }
  [@@deriving size]
end
```

How these attribute values are used is up to the individual deriver at
runtime.

```ocaml
# History.size
    { current_title = "Snakes on a Plane"
    ; previous_titles = [ "Pacific Air Flight 121"; "Snakes on a Plane" ]
    }
- : int = 17
```

For `[@@deriving size]`, all contexts use `Ignore.t` as their
annotation type. Other derivers may use different attribute types for
type expressions, record labels, variant constructors, and polymorphic
variant rows, as needed. See where `Serializations` is defined in
`example/serialization.mli` and `example/serialization.ml`, and where
it is used in `test/test_expansion.ml` and `test/test_runtime.ml`, for
examples of attributes in other positions.

## Deriving values as expressions

You can use the name of your deriver as an extension point to derive
values from type expressions.

```ocaml
# [%size: string list] [ "Pacific Air Flight 121"; "Snakes on a Plane" ]
- : int = 39
```

## Unhygienic names

Inside the generated code for a type with parameters,
`ppx_derive_at_runtime` binds variables to the derived values for
those parameter types. There's generally no reason to refer to them,
but be aware these names are bound in case they shadow some existing
name, however unlikely.

```ocaml
type 'a t =
  | Node of 'a t list
  | Leaf of ('a [@size.custom __'a_size__])
[@@deriving size]
```

Here, `__'a_size__` refers to the size of type parameter
`'a`.

```ocaml
# [%size: string t] (Node [Leaf "let"])
- : int = 3
```

For (mutually) recursive type definitions, `ppx_derive_at_runtime`
binds a lazy version of each derived value. The lazy definitions are
used to "tie the recursive knot" for the mutual recursion. Again,
there is little if any need to refer to these names, and attempting to
force them inside their own definition will either raise or loop
forever.

```ocaml
type t =
  | Zero
  | Plus_one of (t [@size.custom Lazy.force __lazy_size__])
[@@deriving size]
```
```mdx-error
Exception:
("[ppx_derive_at_runtime]: runtime error" //toplevel//:1:1 Lazy.Undefined)
```
